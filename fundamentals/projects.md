### Programming Languages and Markup Languages

#### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1920px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="" data-size="line">HTML

The **HyperText Markup Language** or **HTML** is the standard [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup\_language) for documents designed to be displayed in a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_browser). It can be assisted by technologies such as [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading\_Style\_Sheets) (CSS) and [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting\_language) such as [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_browser) receive HTML documents from a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_server) or from local storage and [render](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser\_engine) the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_page) [semantically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic\_Web) and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

**Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) is a [style sheet language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style\_sheet\_language) used for describing the [presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation\_semantics) of a document written in a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup\_language) such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) or [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading\_Style\_Sheets#cite\_note-1) CSS is a cornerstone technology of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web), alongside HTML and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading\_Style\_Sheets#cite\_note-2)

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including [layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page\_layout), [colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color), and [fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading\_Style\_Sheets#cite\_note-3) This separation can improve content [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility); provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_page) to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be [cached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache\_\(computing\)) to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

#### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" alt="" data-size="line"> JavaScript

**JavaScript** ([/Ààd í…ëÀêv…ôskr…™pt/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)),[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite\_note-10) often abbreviated **JS**, is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_language) that is one of the core technologies of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web), alongside [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite\_note-11) As of 2022, 98% of [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) use JavaScript on the [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client\_\(computing\)) side for [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_page) behavior,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite\_note-deployedstats-12) often incorporating third-party [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_\(computing\)).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite\_note-lib\_usage-13) All major [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_browser) have a dedicated [JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\_engine) to execute the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source\_code) on [users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_\(computing\))' devices.

JavaScript is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level\_programming\_language), often [just-in-time compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time\_compilation) language that conforms to the [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) standard.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite\_note-tc39-14) It has [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_typing), [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based\_programming) [object-orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented\_programming), and [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class\_function). It is [multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_paradigm), supporting [event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven\_programming), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional\_programming), and [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative\_programming) [programming styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_paradigm). It has [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application\_programming\_interface) (APIs) for working with text, dates, [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_expression), standard [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_structure), and the [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document\_Object\_Model) (DOM).

### Libraries and tools

#### <img src="https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/react-1-logo-png-transparent.png" alt="" data-size="line"> ReactJs

**React** (also known as **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_and\_open-source\_software) [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front\_end\_and\_back\_end) [JavaScript library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\_library)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React\_\(JavaScript\_library\)#cite\_note-react-3) for building [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_interfaces) based on UI components. It is maintained by [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta\_Platforms) (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React\_\(JavaScript\_library\)#cite\_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React\_\(JavaScript\_library\)#cite\_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React\_\(JavaScript\_library\)#cite\_note-6) React can be used as a base in the development of [single-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page\_application), mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js). However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document\_Object\_Model), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

**GitLab Inc.** is an [open-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core\_model) company that provides GitLab, a [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) software package that combines the ability to develop, secure, and operate software in a single application.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-Nasdaq-9) The [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source\_software) project was created by [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine) developer Dmitriy Zaporozhets and Dutch developer Sytse Sijbrandij.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-Lee-10) GitLab Inc. was considered the first partly Ukrainian [unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn\_\(finance\)) valued more than $1 billion in 2018.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-12)

Since its founding, GitLab Inc. has been centered around [remote work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote\_work).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-Novet-13) GitLab has an estimated 30 million registered users, with 1 million being active licensed users.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-Nasdaq-9)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab#cite\_note-Goled-14)

## Software Project Management Methodology

### Agile Methodology - Scrum

**Scrum** or **SCRUM**, is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum\_\(software\_development\)#cite\_note-1) with an initial emphasis on [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_development), although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and [advanced technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\_tech).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum\_\(software\_development\)#cite\_note-2) It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called _sprints_, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The scrum team assess progress in [time-boxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums (a form of [stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up\_meeting)). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to [stakeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder\_\(corporate\)) to elicit feedback, and [sprint retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software\_development) which enables the team to reflect and improve.
